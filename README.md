third challenge for bootcamp course

## Project Description

This is my THIRD challenge homework assignment for the BootCamp course titled "Module 3: JavaScript".  The following criteria were given to complete the challenge:

    1. Create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords
    2. Below are the acceptance criteria:
        GIVEN I need a new, secure password
        WHEN I click the button to generate a password
        THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
        WHEN prompted for password criteria
        THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
        WHEN prompted for the length of the password
        THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
        WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
        THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
        WHEN I answer each prompt
        THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
        WHEN all prompts are answered
        THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
        WHEN the password is generated
        THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
        ```
